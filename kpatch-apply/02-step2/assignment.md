## Determine what Kernel Live Patches are available

When Kernel Live Patches are applied to the kernel, functions within the kernel are re-routed from their initial instructions to instead use the functions provided by the kpatch.  The following diagram provides a bit more detail on how this process operates.

This means that a kpatch is produced and tied to a specific version of the kernel.  Before you look at available kernel patches, you should first know the version of the kernel running on your target system.

```bash,run
uname -r
```

<pre class=file>
5.14.0-362.8.1.el9_3.x86_64
</pre>

Our lab system is running kernel version (also known as release, hence the -r
option used by uname) 5.14.0-362.8.1.el9_3.x86_64.

Now that you know the version of the kernel running on the lab machine, look
at all of the aviailable kpatch packages avaiable from the Red Hat Enterprise
Linux repos.

```bash,run
dnf list available kpatch-patch*362*
```

<pre class='file'>
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>

Available Packages
kpatch-patch-5_14_0-362_8_1.x86_64                               0-0.el9_3                                      rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms
</pre>

From the above output, there are several different kpatch-patch patches
available, but only one of them is the one intended for the kernel running on
your system.  The one needed for your system is
`kpatch-patch-5_14_0-362_8_1.x86_64` because it is the latest available for
the version of your kernel reported by `uname -r`, specifically, 5.14.0-362.el9_3.

If you looked at all available `kpatch-patch` packages, you would see others
listed, like `kpatch-patch-5_14_0-162_18_1.x86_64`.  These kpatches are
for another kernel, specifically, version 5.14.0-162.  You can see that
the additional listings are also for addtional kernel releases, __not__ the one
running on your system.

In the next step, you will be applying the kpatch available for your system to the kernel.
