title: Creating an application image from an existing base
notes:
- type: text
  contents: |
    After completing this scenario, users will be able to build images from scratch or existing base images using **buildah** and other host based tools.

    # Concepts included in this scenario:
    * Initializing a working container for image building
    * Using buildah commands to modify a working container
    * Modfiying a working container with standard system tools
    * Creating an application image from a working container

    # Example Usecase:
    Using *podman* with a Containerfile or Dockerfile input is a common way to build containers from base images. However, this lab, Building containers with **buildah**, provides better control over layer creation and image contents.

**Buildah** has two main ways to create images:

* Using subcommands to modify contents
* Using host tools to modify a container filesystem

First, we'll look at using subcommands to modify the container contents before saving an image.  Many **buildah** subcommands act like directives from a Containerfile.  This allows for a familiar experience while automating builds.

The Red Hat Universal Base Image is provided as the starting point for creating containers with Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages.  More information on UBI can be found in the [introductory blog post.](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image)

To build an application container from the `ubi-init` base image, we will create a working container with `buildah`.  A working container is a temporary container used as the target for buildah commands.

```bash,run
buildah from registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-init
```

<pre class="file">
ubi-init-working-container
</pre>

This subcommand acts like the FROM directive in a Containerfile and makes the source image available on the host.

Buildah will append `-working-container` to the image name used.  If that name already exists, a number will also be appended.
