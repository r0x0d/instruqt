  # Concepts included in this scenario:

  * Deploy a container image into an interactive container runtime
  * Deploy a container image into a detached container runtime
  * View deployed containers
  * Stop a container instance
  * Remove deployed container instances

  # Example Usecase:
  You have been asked to deploy a container running a web based application onto a server in your environment.  In addition to deploying it, you need to be able to start alternate copies and remove any non-running containers.
