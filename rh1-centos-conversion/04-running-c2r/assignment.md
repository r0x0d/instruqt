## Understanding the Convert2RHEL command

There are several different combinations of arguments that can be used to execute the conversion process. The main factor is registering your new RHEL system with an active subscription. Your choices are:

1) Fully interactive session: answer questions and input username and password as part of the conversion

2) Including your username and password in the convert2rhel command. This is less desireable since your Red Hat customer portal credentials would then be stored in the server's Bash history in plain text.

3) Including your organization ID and Activation Key as part of the command. This is more secure, however, finding your org-id and creating an activation key are outside the scope of this lab.

## Running the Convert2RHEL utility

<pre class='file'>
convert2rhel --org < ORG ID > --activationkey  < KEY >
</pre>

In order to automate this process as much as possible, you will kick off the conversion using the activation key combination from #3 above:

>**Pro Tip:** The above process can be further automated by adding a `-y` argument to your command!

```bash
convert2rhel --org 12451665 --activationkey convert2rhel -y

```

>**Note:** This process will take some time!

<pre class='file'>
# convert2rhel --org 12451665 --activationkey convert2rhel -y
