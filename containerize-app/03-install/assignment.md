Now that the yum repositories are defined within the container, you can use
another `dnf install`, executed within the container, to install the target
software: `moon-buggy`.

```bash,run
buildah run ubi-working-container -- dnf -y install moon-buggy
```

From the above output, you can see that `moon-buggy` was successfully installed
into the container.  The `dnf` transaction also installed several required
pieces of software as well.
