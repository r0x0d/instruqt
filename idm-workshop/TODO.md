*** TO DO LIST
convert bash scripts for setup to ansible
completion steps for each assignment in ansible
  - ensure that they are additive from the first exercise
  - this will allow the break out into individual units
  - the challenge with this model is the solution time increase with each module
  - this is the obstacle to breaking the workshop up into individual chapters
  - this may be better as 3 workshops than individual assignments
clean up steps for each assignment in ansible - allow users to go backward and redo work.
