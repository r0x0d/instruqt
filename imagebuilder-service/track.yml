title: Building custom images with the Image Builder Service
description: |-
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to define a Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  blueprint in the Red Hat Image Builder tool hosted on the Hybrid Cloud Console. Users will
  then take the resulting image and customize it for their needs.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Using the Image Builder service to define a custom image.
  * Using local tools to further customize the resulting image.

  # Example use case:
  Your organization has specific requirements for their system builds, and you would like to build
  those requirements into a custom image that you can then deploy to your public cloud provider.
