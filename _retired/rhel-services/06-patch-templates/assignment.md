We will now patch our system with patches that were published up to December 31 by creating a patch template with a date of December 31, 2022.

First we'll downgrade `podman`. In the `Terminal`, run the following command.

```bash
dnf -y downgrade podman
```

Now run the `insights-client`.

```bash
insights-client
```

Go to the Systems menu in the Patch application.

![patch systems](../assets/patchsystemsmenu.png)

You'll see that the host has one installable advisory.

![installable advisory](../assets/oneinstallableadvisory.png)

Go to the Patch template application.

![patch template app](../assets/patchtemplateapp.png)

Click the `Create a template` button.

![create a template button](../assets/createatemplatebutton.png)

Perform the following tasks in the `Create content template` menu.

1) Pick the date `2022-12-31`.
2) Click `Next`.

![create content template](../assets/createcontenttemplate.png)
<!--
1) Give the template a name. In this example we'll name it `summit-template`.
2) Set the `Patch template date` to `2022-12-31`.
3) Click `Next`.

![patch template new](../assets/newpatchtemplate.png) -->

<!-- In the `Select systems` menu do the following.

1) Select the host you just launched in AWS.
2) Click `Next`.

![select systems](../assets/selectsystems.png) -->

Do the following in `Details`.

1) Give the template a name (please make it unique).
2) Click `Next`.

![template details](../assets/templatedetails.png)

In the `Systems` menu, do the following.

1) Select the host you provisioned.
2) Click `Next`.

![template systems](../assets/templatesystems.png)

Click `Submit`.

![submit template](../assets/submitpatchtemplate.png)

Once the template has been created, go back to the System view in the Patch application.

![patch systems menu](../assets/patchsystemsmenu.png)

Click on the system you applied the template to.

![system](../assets/templateappliedsystem.png)

You'll find the patch is greyed out and cannot be applied to your system. This is because the podman advisory was published after the date we specified in the Patch template.
