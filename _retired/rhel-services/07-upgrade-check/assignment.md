The RHEL preupgrade analysis utility analyzes RHEL8 and RHEL7 hosts to provide recommendations to minimize problems when upgrading to RHEL9.

First, we'll provision a RHEL8 host. Then we'll run the `RHEL preupgrade analysis utility` against it.

Launch a vm from the `summit-rhel8` image. Do the following.

1) Navigate to the `Image Builder` application.
2) Click on `Launch`, next to the `summit-rhel8` image.

![launch rhel 8](../assets/rhel8launch.png)

The next menu will prefill several values to customize the VM instance. We'll need to choose the instance type `t2.medium` and click `Next`.

Select the SSH public key `rhte_public_key` and click `Next`.

Review the details before clicking `Launch`.

When your instance has launched successfully, copy down the ID, DNS, and SSH command. In particular, save the SSH command.

**Do not close this window.**

You can save the SSH command in the built in `Notepad`.

Then click on the `Notepad` tab.

![notepad](../assets/notepadtab.png)

Click on `/notes/notepad`.

Paste the SSH command into the notepad and save it by clicking on the disk icon.

Navigate to the `RHEL preupgrade analysis utility` in the `Tasks` menu under `Toolkit`.

![analysis utility](../assets/toolkittasks.png)

Click on `Run task`.

![run task](../assets/runtask.png)

Select the RHEL8 system you just provisioned and click execute.

It will take a few minutes for the job to complete.

Go to the `Activity` tab and the last job run to view the analysis.

You might have to sort the Status and Run date/Time columns to find your job.

![sort](../assets/sortanalysis.png)

Click on the task.

![completed](../assets/completedanalysis.png)

Expand the System name to view the report.

This completes all lab activities.
