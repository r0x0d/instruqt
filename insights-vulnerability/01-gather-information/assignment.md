    After completing this scenario, users will be able to identify vulnerabilities that
    affect systems registered to Red Hat Insights using the Red Hat Insights Vulnerability tool.
    They will also learn how to remediate these vulnerabilities.

    # Concepts included in this scenario:
    * View Red Hat Insights Vulnerability results that are reported for the system on console.redhat.com.
    * Apply a recommended remediation for the system.
    * Validate that the remediation was successful.

    # Example Use case:
    You need to report out what systems are impacted by a given vulnerability, or generate
    a report showing what CVEs may impact your fleet for auditing purposes.

    Systems are impacted by a new vulnerability which a remediation exists for.
    Administrators would like to apply specific fixes to their systems without the
    need for broader system updates.

This lab system is already registered with Red Hat's [Hybrid Cloud Console](https://cloud.redhat.com) using the Red Hat Remote Host Configuration utility `rhc`.  We will ensure that the system is connected and running the correct services.

```bash,run
rhc connect
```

You should get output similar to this:

<pre class=file>
Connecting rhel-149ae to Red Hat.
This might take a few seconds.

● This system is already connected to Red Hat Subscription Management
● Connected to Red Hat Insights
● Activated the Remote Host Configuration daemon
● Enabled console.redhat.com services: remote configuration, insights, remediations, compliance

Successfully connected to Red Hat!

Manage your connected systems: https://red.ht/connector
</pre>

You can see that the system's hostname is included in the output, in this case it is the following:

```text
[[ Instruqt-Var key="VM_HOSTNAME" hostname="rhel" ]]
```

You will need this hostname later, so jot it down.

Let's refresh this hosts insights data, and then continue.

Run the following command on your host:

```bash,run
insights-client
```
